Followed by some twists and turns and now here I am becoming a Business Analyst. Using data-driven logic along with emotional intelligence and creativity for visualizations to bring forth the best analysis easy for others to understand. Some tools that I use to contribute to strong and clear solutions are Tableau, Power BI, PostgreSQL, and Google Sheets. With this, I am happy to participate in any outsourced projects.

Some fun facts about me:

- I enjoy continual learning.
- I love engaging in outdoor activities.
- Holistic healing and natural remedies are a big interest to me.
- I am excited to learn more about cooking Asian cuisine and desserts (specifically Japanese).
- My goals for 2024: develop my skills as a BI Analyst and land a job with a company of interest!

Please feel free to contact me! :]
